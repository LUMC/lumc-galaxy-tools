This is a fork of the data_manager_all_fasta_by_path data manager
by Cristian-B (https://github.com/Christian-B)
(https://github.com/Christian-B/galaxy_shedtools/tree/master/all_fasta_by_path).
The all_fasta_by_path data manager was forked on 2017-09-07 from
Christian-B's galaxy_shedtools repository at commit d9f5343.
(https://github.com/Christian-B/galaxy_shedtools).

The tool has drastically changed since then, with a complete refactoring
of the python script and the addition of unit tests for all functionality
within the python script. A lot of indexes are now supported in addition to
just the all_fasta one.
